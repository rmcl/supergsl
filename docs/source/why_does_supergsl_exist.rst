Why SuperGSL?
######################################

SuperGSL was created by `Russell McLoughlin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/russmcl/>`_. It is inspired by the original Genome Specification Language (See: `Paper <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00194>`_ & `Code <https://github.com/Amyris/GslCore>`_ written by Erin Wilson, Darren Platt and many others at Amyris. The author wanted to learn more about genetic engineering, but had a really hard time coming up to speed with the open source GSL code base.
