# Common Use Cases

**Strain engineers often want to do things:**

1. Knockout a gene
2. Add an extra copy of a gene (overexpress)
5. Introduce non-native genes
4. Introduce a mutation to an gene
6. Introduce an exact nucleotide sequence into a gene


## Knockout a Gene

*Using a CRISPR gRNA and Homologous Recombination*

Scientists may want to remove a gene from an organism. One approach is to first generate a template DNA part that connects the upstream and downstream flanking of target gene to be removed. Then introduce a double stranded break in the gene of interest. Allow homologous recombination to fix the cut with the provided template DNA.

```
uHO ; dHO
```

```
gHO^
```

```
marker {
    gHO^
}
```
## Add an extra copy of a native gene (overexpress)

## Introduce non-native genes

## Introduce a mutation to an gene

## Introduce an exact nucleotide sequence into a gene
