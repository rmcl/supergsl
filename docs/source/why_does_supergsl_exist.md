# Why SuperGSL?

SuperGSL was created by Russell McLoughlin. It is inspired by the original Genome Specification Language (See: [Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.5b00194) & [Code](https://github.com/Amyris/GslCore)) written by Erin Wilson, Darren Platt and many others at Amyris. The [author](https://github.com/rmcl) wanted to learn more about genetic engineering, but had a really hard time coming up to speed with the open source GSL code base. Read more of why SuperGSL exists [here](gsl_vs_supergsl).
