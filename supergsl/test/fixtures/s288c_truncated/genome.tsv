YBR020W	gene	?	YBR020W	GAL1	GAL1,galactokinase	chromosome 2		2	279020	280606	W				Galactokinase; phosphorylates alpha-D-galactose to alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate in the first step of galactose catabolism; expression regulated by Gal4p; GAL1 has a paralog, GAL3, that arose from the whole genome duplication genome duplication
YDR009W	gene	?	YDR009W	GAL3	GAL3,transcriptional regulator GAL3	chromosome 4		4	463433	464995	W				Transcriptional regulator; involved in activation of the GAL genes in response to galactose; forms a complex with Gal80p to relieve Gal80p inhibition of Gal4p; binds galactose and ATP but does not have galactokinase activity; GAL3 has a paralog, GAL1, that arose from the whole genome duplication
YDL227C	gene	?	YDL227C	HO	HO	chromosome 4		4	46270	48030	C				Site-specific endonuclease; required for gene conversion at the MAT locus (homothallic switching) through the generation of a ds DNA break; expression restricted to mother cells in late G1 as controlled by Swi4p-Swi6p, Swi5p, and Ash1p
YML058W-A	gene	?	YML058W-A	HUG1	HUG1	chromosome 13		13	158759	158965	W				Protein involved in the Mec1p-mediated checkpoint pathway; transcription is induced by DNA damage; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress
YML075C	gene	?	YML075C	HMG1	HMG1,hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) HMG1	chromosome 13		13	115733	118897	C				HMG-CoA reductase; catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is a rate-limiting step in sterol biosynthesis; one of two isozymes; localizes to the nuclear envelope; overproduction induces the formation of karmellae; forms foci at the nuclear periphery upon DNA replication stress; HMG1 has a paralog, HMG2, that arose from the whole
