            The left part sample is cut out with EcoRI and SpeI.
            The right part sample is cut out with XbaI and PstI.

            The linearized plasmid backbone is a linear piece of DNA and should

        2. Perform Ligation Reaction
            An equimolar quantity of all 3 restriction digest products are
            combined in a ligation reaction.

            Goal: The desired result is the left part sample's SpeI overhang
            ligated with the right part sample's XbaI overhang resulting in a
            scar that cannot be cut with any of our enzymes.

            The new composite part sample is ligated into the construction
            plasmid backbone at the EcoRI and PstI sites. When the ligation is
            transformed into cells and grown on plates with antibiotic C, only
            colonies with the correct construction survive.
