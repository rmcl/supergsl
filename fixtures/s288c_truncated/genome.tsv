YBR020W	gene	?	YBR020W	GAL1	GAL1,galactokinase	chromosome 2		2	279020	280606	W				Galactokinase; phosphorylates alpha-D-galactose to alpha-D-galactose-1-phosphate in the first step of galactose catabolism; expression regulated by Gal4p; GAL1 has a paralog, GAL3, that arose from the whole genome duplication
YML058W-A	gene	?	YML058W-A	HUG1	HUG1	chromosome 13		13	158759	158965	W				Protein involved in the Mec1p-mediated checkpoint pathway; transcription is induced by DNA damage; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress
